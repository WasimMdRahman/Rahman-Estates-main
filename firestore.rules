/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for the Aether Estates real estate application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is primarily user-centric. User data is strictly private and owned by the user.
 * Public data, like property listings, is readable by anyone but has restricted write access.
 * The default posture is to deny all access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user profiles and serves as the root for user-owned subcollections.
 * - /users/{userId}/likedProperties/{propertyId}: A user-specific subcollection containing properties they have liked.
 * - /properties/{propertyId}: A top-level collection for all property listings, intended for public browsing.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Restricted Property Writes: Writing to the public `/properties` collection is disabled for all clients by default. This assumes property listings are managed by a trusted backend or admin role, which is the most secure default when an ownership model isn't defined.
 * - Structural Segregation: A user's private list of "liked" properties is stored in a separate `/users/{userId}/likedProperties` subcollection. This is more secure and performant for queries than storing all likes in a single collection with access flags.
