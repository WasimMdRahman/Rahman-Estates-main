## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6F2DBD), inspired by royalty and exclusivity, representing premium real estate offerings.
- Background color: Obsidian dark (#0B091A), almost black, setting a luxurious and high-end tone. This hue visually aligns with the primary purple, but is heavily desaturated for the background.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#B19CD9), analogous to the primary purple, providing a gentle contrast and highlighting interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to convey elegance, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text for readability.
- Lucide-React icons for a clean and modern look.
- Glassmorphism effect with high-opacity backdrop-blur-xl and a 1px white/10 border for UI components.
- Staggered Clip-Path animation for the 'Reveal' entrance effect on page load.
- Magnetic effect on 'View Property' buttons, subtly gravitating towards the mouse cursor.
- Smooth scrolling with a scale-up parallax effect for property images.
- 3D tilt effect on property cards during hover, with the background gradient glowing and following the mouse.
- AnimatePresence for interactive page transitions with smooth background mesh gradient shifts.
- Flurry of small floating heart particles on liking a property, using canvas or Framer Motion.
