Authorization Independence is achieved through denormalization of authorization data. Path-Based Ownership and Membership Maps are used to model access consistently.\\n\\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. This enables simple ownership-based rules for user-specific data.\\n*   `/properties/{propertyId}`: Stores property listings. Anyone can read but restricted write access.\\n*   `/users/{userId}/likedProperties/{propertyId}`: Stores the user's liked properties, ensuring proper ownership and data isolation.\\n\\nThe structure supports required QAPs:\\n\\n*   Property Listings: List operations are secure, as rules can filter properties based on attributes like price, location, etc., without requiring complex `get()` calls.\\n*   Liked Properties: List operations are secure because each liked property is stored under the user's document, ensuring that only the user can access their liked properties."
